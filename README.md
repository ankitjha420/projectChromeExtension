<h1>Chrome Extension URL logger</h1>

  
    
    Written using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS, this extension can capture the active tab's URL on your Chrome browser using Chrome's API.
    It can be used to save links, make bookmarks etc.
    Users can also manually feed url link and save it. The "Delete All" button clears all the saved links.
    The links are stored in localStorage object of chrome, so they dont disappear if you close the extension.
